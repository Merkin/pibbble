                <h3>What's a Pibbble Meetup?</h3>
                <p>
                    A Pibbble meetup is a chance for Pibbblers to socialize and talk shop, and foster their local development communities. Beyond that, it's up to the organizer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pibbble Meetups are self-organised events that range from the casual, five-person, coffee-shop roundtable to the chef-catered, bar-tended, 200-person extravaganza.

            <h3>Whatâ€™s an Analog Playoff?</h3>
                <p>
                    A pencil-on-paper contest in which organizers provide  problems and attendees solve the problem without using computers. Problems are usually algorithmic but could be anything the organisers feel is solvable by pen and paper.
